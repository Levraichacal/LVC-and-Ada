Some changes to the commenting system
=====================================

I had Disqus, the commenting system, slightly misconfigured, so I redid
the commenting section. Because of this, the existing comments were lost,
but hopefully everyone can live with it.

Now the Disqus settings should be ok, but as ways with Internet pages,
I don't guarantee that your comments will be visible forever. If you
place a comment on this blog, you should probably expect it to
disappear within a month or two to avoid bigger disappointments.
I don't delete comments on purpose, but since the blog is
only a collection of static pages, I have "outsourced" comments
to 3rd party and don't have that much control over them.
