About

:slug: about

This blog (`arduino.ada-language.com`_) is about running Ada
software on Arduinos_ and AVR processors using `AVR-Ada`_.

The articles are written by `Tero Koskinen`_, but guest writers
are welcome also.

Technical details
-----------------

The blog itself is a set of static HTML pages, which
are generated by Pelican_ blogging engine. I have outsourced
comments to Disqus and image hosting to Flickr_.

At the moment, the blog is hosted on a simple shared
web host, but most likely it will be moved to a dedicated
server later, thanks to increased traffic lately (2013 May).

The blog articles, theme, and other related settings can
be found from my `arduino-blog <https://bitbucket.org/tkoskine/arduino-blog>`_
repository.
