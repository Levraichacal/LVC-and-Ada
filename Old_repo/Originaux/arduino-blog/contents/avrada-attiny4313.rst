A short note that I just pushed support for attiny4313 processor
to AVR-Ada repository. I am not sure does that make into AVR-Ada 1.2.x
release, but most likely it will be in AVR-Ada 1.2.x+1 or 1.3.x release.

In theory, support for attiny4313 should be equal to attiny2313 support
but I admit that I haven't tested all the features yet.
