   -- Procedure to write an analog level on a nomport. The level should be between
   -- 0 and 511 and it works for D9 and D10.
   -- For D3, D5, D6 and D11, the value write is val = (value + 1)/2 -1
   -- For the others, when the value is under 256 it's off, and when the
   -- value is above or equal 256 it's on.
